**Summary**

The project aims to observe the evolution of some parameters, such as electric vehicle sales and populations along with their relationships in specific countries including Turkey, and how they have affected the transport carbondioxide emissions through the years 2011 to 2021. The study also focuses on the EV adoption, interprets current standings and proposes actionable recommendations to enhance sustainability in the transportation sector.
