    "text": "(a) Brief Summary of Baydoğan’s Speech:\nThroughout the seminar, he discussed how machine learning can be applied to company operations and optimization to forecast sales accurately and keep the balance of production and consumption. While doing this, one forecast might be followed by another forecast, which makes the decision making processes more complicated and results in lots of the data to be processed. He mentioned the traditional learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning and preference learning processes to be able to make an explainable and robust arguments to managers and colleagues on the final decision and its effects on the market in a way that answering possible reasons of applications. He emphasized that the wrong predictions result in penalty costs to companies. He also talked about integrating forecasting models into our mathematical models and how they can be explained through visualizations. One of the discussion is to consider customers’ activities and their interests in online shopping platforms to make customizations and statistical analyses on the ordering algorithms. In the Q&A part, he suggested taking responsibilities and encountering real life problems to be able to improve in the field of data science.\n\nOpen Ended Question:\nWhich machine learning technique can be used to improve optimization?\n\n\nAnswer:\nAs far as I am concerned that it is not always easy and quick to solve optimization problems. For instance, variations in the amount of product to be shipped to some destination center stems from the dynamic conditions that affect the company operations, and these conditions can make optimization problems more challenging. With the advent of AI technologies, reinforcement learning, which is a sub-field of machine learning, is being applied across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Reinforcement learning involves the use of a trial-and-error approach to address decision-making problems, just as Baydoğan explained in the seminar. It is used in dynamic environments to solve complex multi-objective optimization problems faster.\n\n\nMultiple Choice Question:\nWhich of the following is a FALSE statement about human activities on decision-making?\n\n(a) Dealing with insufficient data requires high level of human resource.\n\n\n(b) Predictions used for decision-making should be 100% correct.\n\n\n(c) Reinforcement learning techniques are very important for decision-making.\n\n\n(d) Models should be basic and explainable by humans.\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nPredictions may be misleading and the risk of wrong predictions should be considered in decision-making. Therefore, the answer is (b).",
